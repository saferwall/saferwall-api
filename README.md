## Preface
This repository powers the web service api used in https://saferwall.com.
This web service uses [Echo](https://echo.labstack.com/) as web application framework, [Couchbase](https://www.couchbase.com/) as NoSQL database and [Zap logger](https://pkg.go.dev/go.uber.org/zap) as logger.
This sample application provides only several functions as Web APIs.
Please refer to the 'Service' section about the detail of those functions.
